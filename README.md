**Note:** this is something I don't want to call attention to.


## Part I. Instruction on How to use this Workshop Toturial

### R Code Box
The text in the box with black background contains the R codes that you can highlight, copy and paste into your R command-line interface.
For example:
``` R
#Below is a working R code that you can copy and paste into your R to execuate some R commands
ls()
message("Hello! Welcome to the RESISTPART Bioinformatics Workshop")
```
<table width="100%">
  <tr><th style="text-align:left" >Alternative</th></tr>
<tr><td>this is a alternative box</td><tr>
</table>

**Note:** a note is something that needs to be mentioned but is apart from the context.
