## Part I. Instroduction - how to use this workshop tutorial

### 1. R Code Box
The text in the light-blue box, contains the R codes that you can highlight (by dragging your mouse), copy (use the control-C key combination) and paste (control-V) into your R command-line interface on your computer. For example:
``` R
#Below is a working R code that you can copy and paste into your R to execuate some R commands
ls()
message("Hello! Welcome to the RESISTPART Bioinformatics Workshop")
```

### 2. Alternative method box

Text inside the alternative method box, shows another or more different ways of doing the same thing:

<table bgcolor="#C8FBD3"><tr><td style="font-size:0.8em" width="100%">
<b>Alternative:</b><br>
This is where other ways of doing the same thing will be described
</td></tr></table>

### 3. Notes and comments

<table  bgcolor="#DDDDDD"><tr><td style="font-size:0.8em;font-style:italic;">
  <b>Note:</b> A note is something that needs to be mentioned but is apart from the context.
</td></tr></table>

## Part II. Workshop Tutorial

#### Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences for microbiome diversity study

### 1. Introduction

The goal of this workshop is to help us learn how to analyze the 16S rRNA gene sequences generated by the next generation sequencing (NGS) platform, such as the Illumina sequencers. A region of the 16S rRNA gene is first PCR-amplified from the DNA extracted from environmental or clinical samples. The amplicons are then sequenced by the NGS technology to produce millions of DNA reads. 

### 2. Installation of the R software and packages for analyzing microbiome sequence data

### 3. Basic R operations

```R
#This is R code box
ls()
save.image()
```

### 4. Use of the R DADA2 package to process the 16S rRNA gene sequence reads

### 5. Use of the R Phyloseq package to study microbial diversity

### 6. Use of the MicrobiomeAnalyst online tools for statistical, visual and meta-analysis of microbiome data

Link to Archal's MicrobiomeAnalyst tutorial

### 7. Beyond microbiome sequence data â€“ Meta-genomic and Meta-transcriptomic data


```R
